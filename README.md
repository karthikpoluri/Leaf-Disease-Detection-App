# Leaf-Disease-Detection-App
I have built an android app using KIVY for my Deep Learning model that will do crop disease detection on leaf images.

I am not able to provide the model building and the model structures due to some confidentiality reasons but what I can do is to provide you with the demo model that I trained on the MobilenetV2 for this project. My original model was trained on Ensemble techniques of Deep Learning. 

## KIVY Application:
I have used this KIVY Application to demonstrate the model efficiency to interested people, but when it comes to my real-time project I am intended to go for the Android app. Thank you for the time have a great day and feel free to access the content.
